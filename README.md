Scripts
=======

A simple set of scripts I use/wrote, using standard commands where i can, that I know off. They are  not "great", but figgered someone might like them, as well as wanting a place I can keep them, so I upped them here. 

Most should work on any standard Linux distro (thus the standard commands), though autoremove is a simple pacman command to remove all unused apps (ala apt-get autoremove), thus only work on Arch, and derivative.
